## User Story

AS an avid reader

I WANT to view a terms' definition and an associated image

SO THAT I can better understand the content of my readings

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a personal dictionary based on terms I've read

WHEN I search for a term and enter the original source of where I encountered the term

THEN I am presented with a definition and image for that term and that term is added to the search history

WHEN I view the definition for that term

THEN I am presented with the term, the part of speech, the pronunciation, the language of origin, the definition, and an image

WHEN I click on a term in the search history

THEN I am again presented with the term, the part of speech, the pronunciation, the language of origin, the definition, and an image
